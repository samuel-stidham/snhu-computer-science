## Key Topics & Concepts

This course focused on developing a core understanding of ethical theory, its application, and its analysis:

* **Five Core Ethical Frameworks:**
    * **Rights Framework:** Focuses on fundamental moral rights (autonomy, privacy, dignity) that must be respected.
    * **Virtue Framework:** Focuses on character, cultivating virtues like honesty and integrity, and acting in alignment with a moral identity.
    * **Utilitarian Framework:** Focuses on consequences, seeking the "greatest balance of good over harm" for the largest number of people.
    * **Care Ethics Framework:** Focuses on relationships and responsibilities, valuing empathy and the unique context of human needs.
    * **Justice Framework:** Focuses on fairness and impartiality, analyzing the equitable distribution of benefits and burdens (e.g., John Rawls' "veil of ignorance").
* **Professional Codes of Ethics:** Examination and application of professional standards, including the **ACM Code of Ethics**, to ensure professional responsibility in technology and computing roles.
* **Ethical Analysis and Argumentation:** Developing structured ethical arguments by identifying stakeholders, analyzing moral issues, and using frameworks to evaluate solutions.
* **Global & Social Issues:** Exploration of civil disobedience, global justice, and the complexities of ethical consumption.

## Major Projects & Assignments

The following major assignments demonstrate my application of the course material. (Note: Specific homework files are not included to maintain academic integrity.)

1.  **Project Name/Purpose: Comprehensive Ethical Analysis (Final Project)**
    * **Project Topic:** **An Ethical Analysis of Privacy, Free Speech, and the Right to Be Forgotten.**
    * **Focus:** Analyzing the conflict between the individual's Right to Privacy and society's Right to the Truth. The final recommendation justified a **Case-by-Case Hybrid model** using the **Rights Framework** and the **ACM Code of Ethics**, while simultaneously analyzing the ethical risk of entrusting private corporations with the power to curate public memory.
    * **Deliverables:** Multi-part project including a Proposal, Draft Introduction/Background, Draft Options/Recommendation, and a 250-point Final Project.

2.  **Journal Reflection: Moral Intuition vs. Ethical Framework**
    * **Focus:** Analyzing an early-career dilemma (accidental gift card order) to show how fear-based bias can compromise moral intuition. The analysis demonstrated how the **Virtue Ethics Framework** provides the clarity to choose integrity and transparency over self-protection.

3.  **Journal Reflection: The Ethics of Civil Disobedience**
    * **Focus:** Exploring the conditions under which nonviolent civil disobedience is ethically justified (using Utilitarian, Rights, and Justice Frameworks) and arguing why practitioners should still accept legal punishment to maintain the integrity of the rule of law.

4.  **Journal Reflection: My Struggle to Be an Ethical Shopper**
    * **Focus:** A personal reflection analyzing the conflict between individual budget pragmatism and the ethical ideals of **Justice** and **Utilitarianism** when making purchasing decisions. The reflection contrasted personal compromises with the mission-driven, uncompromising corporate ethics of companies like Patagonia.

## Selected Discussion & Analysis Highlights

These highlights showcase my application of ethical frameworks to real-world issues encountered during weekly course discussions:

* **Ethical Argument: Professional Integrity vs. Technical Debt**
    * **Frameworks Used:** Professional Duty (ACM Code), Utilitarianism (Harm Reduction).
    * **Core Claim:** A software engineer has an ethical obligation to advocate for addressing critical security vulnerabilities, even against short-term business pressure, because the **foreseeable risk of a data breach** (harm) outweighs the temporary cost of refactoring. This duty aligns with the ACM principle to "Avoid harm."
* **Ethical Issue in the Media: AI-Generated Art**
    * **Frameworks Used:** Rights, Justice.
    * **Analysis:** Focused on the ethical dilemmas of **fairness and consent** when AI models are trained on millions of copyrighted human artworks without compensation, posing a direct threat to artists' livelihoods and raising questions of authorship and plagiarism.
* **Ethical Conflict: Cronyism in the Workplace**
    * **Framework Used:** Justice.
    * **Analysis:** Applied the Justice Framework to a "quiet promotion" based on personal friendship, arguing the action violates the core principle of justice because the benefit was distributed based on irrelevant factors (bias) rather than relevant ones (merit and objective qualification), undermining workplace trust.
* **Global Justice: Fast Fashion Ethics**
    * **Frameworks Used:** Utilitarianism, Justice.
    * **Analysis:** Used Utilitarianism to weigh the consumer's short-term benefit (cheap clothes) against the massive harm to garment workers (poor pay, unsafe conditions). Concluded that a pragmatic, gradual approach is often chosen, but this highlights the gap between individual ethics and the need for corporate responsibility.

## Personal Reflection & Takeaways

The most valuable outcome of this course was the **reengineering of my personal ethical framework**—a synthesis of personal intuition and the five formal course frameworks. The course provided the formal language and structure to connect my intuition to time-tested philosophical foundations, resulting in a robust, four-principle ethical system: **Justice Through the Veil of Ignorance**, **Compassion in Action**, **Integrity in Engagement**, and **The Pursuit of Wisdom**.

This intellectual exercise taught me that ethical clarity requires more than good intentions. It demands **deliberate, structured action** and **courageous transparency**—a vital lesson for any software engineering professional. The course equipped me with a robust process to navigate complex issues like data privacy and AI bias, ensuring that the software I build upholds human dignity and promotes social justice by using tools like the **ACM Code of Ethics** in my professional deliberations.
