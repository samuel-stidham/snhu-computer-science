## Major Projects & Assignments (Ongoing)

### Discussion Activity: Surface Area Analysis of a Cylinder

**Focus**:

This activity explored how the surface area of a cylinder changes with respect to its radius when the height is fixed, and how to reverse that relationship to express the radius as a function of surface area. The work required applying concepts from inverse functions, domain restrictions, completing the square, and quadratic relationships.

**What I Examined **: I analyzed the surface area formula for a cylinder and derived an inverse function that expresses the radius in terms of the total surface area. I also evaluated the physical constraints on the domain (e.g., the radius must be positive) and interpreted their meaning in a real-world modeling context.

A follow-up question from the instructor asked how the relationship would change if the cylinder's height were doubled. My extended analysis examined how altering a constant term affects the linear and quadratic components of the function, and how these changes propagate to the inverse function. This included comparing how the radius must change to keep the total surface area constant as the height increases — revealing an inverse scaling relationship between height and radius.

**Instructor Feedback Highlights**:

My professor emphasized that the work demonstrated a strong grasp of inverse functions and quadratic structure, especially the recognition that physical constraints require the radius to remain positive. The instructor also noted the quality of my reasoning in tracking how changes in one geometric parameter alter the entire functional relationship, and praised the clear explanation connecting algebraic manipulation to an intuitive geometric interpretation.

### Project / Discussion – Exponential Models

In this project, I examined exponential growth by analyzing long-term trends in transistor counts using Moore's Law as the guiding model. The assignment required estimating values from a logarithmic-scale chart and applying the doubling-time framework associated with Moore's Law to make forward-looking predictions. The focus was on interpreting exponential behavior, understanding why logarithmic scales are used to visualize rapid growth, and considering how mathematical models reflect or diverge from real technological development.

The discussion also involved evaluating whether long-range exponential forecasts remain realistic when compared with actual observed trends. This opened the door to examining why Moore's Law has begun to slow, including physical, economic, and material constraints. In response to the professor's follow-up questions, I explored potential future computing paradigms—such as quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, and 3D integrated circuits—and how each represents either an extension of current technology or a redefinition of what "scaling" means. The conversation ultimately emphasized that while exponential growth may not continue indefinitely, alternative architectures offer new avenues for computational advancement.

The subsequent exchange with the professor centered on articulating the distinctions between extending Moore's Law and redefining it, as well as identifying how different computing approaches target different classes of problems. The discussion highlighted the ability of mathematical models to guide interpretation, the importance of comparing predictions with real data, and the value of examining emerging technologies in the context of long-term growth patterns.

### Project One Summary

Project One assessed my ability to work with a broad range of foundational Precalculus skills by completing twelve problems covering rational, radical, inverse, exponential, and logarithmic functions. The assignment required identifying key properties of rational and radical functions, calculating inverse functions, and translating real-world scenarios into inverse models. It also involved evaluating and graphing exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as solving exponential and logarithmic equations using appropriate algebraic and graphical techniques. The final portion of the project asked me to apply both exponential and logarithmic models to contextual situations, demonstrating how these function types can be used to interpret or predict real-world behavior. Overall, the project provided a comprehensive review of multiple nonlinear function families and reinforced my ability to analyze, manipulate, and interpret them using the methods taught in the course.

## Personal Reflection & Takeaways

* **Personal Challenge:** (E.g., Successfully mastering the unit circle after many years, or developing strong computational problem-solving habits.)

### Relevance to CS

One of the most unexpected and meaningful insights I gained during this course was the conceptual bridge between asymptotes in mathematics and asymptotic notation in computer science. Precalculus never mentioned algorithm analysis, and none of my CS courses explicitly linked these two ideas, yet through our work with rational functions, limits, and behavior near infinity, the connection became unmistakably clear.

Both concepts describe behavior as a function that grows without bound. In mathematics, asymptotes describe how a curve approaches a line as the input size becomes large; in CS, asymptotic notation describes how an algorithm's running time approaches a growth rate as the input size increases. Seeing these as two expressions of the same underlying idea—examining long-term behavior rather than exact values—has deepened my intuition for both subjects.

This realization helped me reframe algorithmic complexity not just as symbolic notation, but as a kind of "behavioral limit," similar to how functions behave near infinity. It was a moment where mathematics directly strengthened my understanding of computer science, even though the connection emerged independently of any formal instruction. Discussions with my professor helped confirm the validity of this relationship, making the insight even more impactful.
