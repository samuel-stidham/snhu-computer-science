## Major Projects & Assignments

The grading structure for this course emphasizes practical application through reflections and a comprehensive final project.

1.  **Final Project: Toolkit for Digital Citizenship and Growth**
    * **Focus:** A three-part synthesis (Modules 3, 5, 7) creating a personal guide for navigating digital spaces and decision-making.
    * **Key Components:**
        * **Digital Literacy:** Analyzed "Active Reading" and the importance of netiquette in technical spaces.
        * **Growth Mindset:** Detailed the "Iterative Journaling" strategy to manage the transition back to academia.
        * **Decision Making:** Applied the **SIFT Method** (Stop, Investigate, Find, Trace) and the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" principle to information verification, using the purchase of **Grammarly** and **Wolfram Mathematica** as a case study.

2.  **Written Assignment: Digital Ecosystems for Growth**
    * **Focus:** A comparative analysis of two distinct digital communities: the **Digital Marketing Professionals LinkedIn Group** (Professional/Networking) and the **r/AskScience Subreddit** (Academic/Fact-Checking).
    * **Analysis:** Contrasted the career-focused utility of LinkedIn with the strict moderation and peer-review culture of scientific subreddits.

3.  **Journals & Reflections:**
    * **Embracing a Growth Mindset:** A personal narrative analyzing the professional transition from **PHP specialization to Go (Golang) and Kubernetes**. Framed the steep learning curve not as a barrier, but as a necessary friction for growth.
    * **The Role of Feedback:** Analyzed contrasting feedback styles (Critical/Vague vs. Empathetic/Specific) within an Agile/Scrum context. Developed a strategy to separate "identity" from "output" when receiving code reviews.
    * **Expert Evaluator:** Applied Servant Leadership and CSM (Certified Scrum Master) principles to a scenario involving an absent team member, prioritizing "psychological safety" over immediate punitive action.

## Personal Reflection & Takeaways

The most significant realization from this course was the shift in my understanding of digital identity from "Consumer" to **"Steward of Verification."**

* **Valuable Insight:** The **Me/We/Beyond** framework highlighted that in a saturated digital market, my professional identity is defined by the integrity of the information I verify and share. The "garbage in, garbage out" principle applies as much to social discourse as it does to software algorithms.
* **Career Impact:** The coursework on **Feedback and Emotional Intelligence** challenged my previous prioritization of "efficiency" above all else. As a lead engineer and CSM, I learned that delivering "efficient" but harsh feedback creates technical debt by lowering team morale. I am now focusing on cultivating a culture of trust where technical rigor and psychological safety coexist.
