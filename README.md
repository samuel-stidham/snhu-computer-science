# My SNHU Computer Science Journey

This repository serves as a public portfolio of my academic work at Southern New Hampshire University. It focuses on summarizing course concepts and key learning outcomes, demonstrating my progression without sharing specific assignments or solutions.

The primary goal is to maintain a high-integrity record of my academic growth that can be shared with potential employers.

## Structure

* The `README.md` (this file) provides a high-level, chronological overview of my coursework and degree path.

* The `docs/` folder contains in-depth summaries for each course, detailing key concepts, projects, and personal reflections. **Note**: Files will only be added to this folder as courses are in progress or completed.
